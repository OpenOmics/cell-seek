    This is the home of the pipeline, cell-seek. Its long-term goals: to accurately process and analyze single cell data like no pipeline before!

</div>

## Overview
Welcome to cell-seek! Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through [cell-seek's documentation](https://openomics.github.io/cell-seek/).

The **`./cell-seek`** pipeline is composed several inter-related sub commands to setup and run the pipeline across different systems. Each of the available sub commands perform different functions: 

 * [<code>cell-seek <b>run</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/cell-seek/usage/run/): Run the cell-seek pipeline with your input files.
 * [<code>cell-seek <b>genome</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/cell-seek/usage/genome/): Create a custom genome reference file that can be used with the pipeline.
 * [<code>cell-seek <b>unlock</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/cell-seek/usage/unlock/): Unlocks a previous runs output directory.
 * [<code>cell-seek <b>cache</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/cell-seek/usage/cache/): Cache remote resources locally, coming soon!

**cell-seek** is a comprehensive set of pipelines to perform the initial processing of different single cell technologies. It relies on technologies like [Singularity<sup>1</sup>](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) to maintain the highest-level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by [Snakemake<sup>2</sup>](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster.

The pipeline is compatible with data generated from Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. As input, it accepts a set of FastQ files and can be run locally on a compute instance or on-premise using a cluster. A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM (more coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users.

Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the [usage](https://openomics.github.io/cell-seek/usage/run/) section of each available sub command.

## Dependencies
**Requires:** `singularity>=3.5`  `snakemake>=6.0`

At the current moment, the pipeline uses a mixture of enviroment modules and docker images; however, this will be changing soon! In the very near future, the pipeline will only use docker images. With that being said, [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) and [singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/all-releases) must be installed on the target system. Snakemake orchestrates the execution of each step in the pipeline. To guarantee the highest level of reproducibility, each step of the pipeline will rely on versioned images from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/nciccbr/repositories). Snakemake uses singularity to pull these images onto the local filesystem prior to job execution, and as so, snakemake and singularity will be the only two dependencies in the future.

## Installation
Please clone this repository to your local filesystem using the following command:
```bash
# Clone Repository from Github
git clone https://github.com/OpenOmics/cell-seek.git
# Change your working directory
cd cell-seek/
# Add dependencies to $PATH
# Biowulf users should run
module load snakemake singularity
# Get usage information
./cell-seek -h
```
