This guide is the main source of documentation for users that are getting started with cell-seek.</p> <p>The <code>./cell-seek</code> pipeline is composed several inter-related sub commands to setup and run the pipeline across different systems. Each of the available sub commands perform different functions:</p> <ul> <li><code>cell-seek run</code>: Run the cell-seek pipeline with your input files.</li> <li><code>cell-seek genome</code>: Create a custom genome reference file that can be used with the pipeline.</li> <li><code>cell-seek unlock</code>: Unlocks a previous runs output directory.</li> <li><code>cell-seek shinycell</code>: Build a ShinyCell2 application from a Seurat RDS object.</li> <li><code>cell-seek cache</code>: Cache remote resources locally, coming soon!</li> </ul> <p>cell-seek is a comprehensive set of pipelines to perform the initial processing of different single cell technologies. It relies on technologies like Singularity<sup>1</sup> to maintain the highest-level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by Snakemake<sup>2</sup>, a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster.</p> <p>The pipeline is compatible with data generated from Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. As input, it accepts a set of FastQ files and can be run locally on a compute instance or on-premise using a cluster. A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM (more coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users.</p> <p>Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the usage section of each available sub command.</p> <p>For more information about issues or trouble-shooting a problem, please checkout our FAQ prior to opening an issue on Github.</p>"},{"location":"#contribute","title":"Contribute","text":"<p>This site is a living document, created for and by members like you. cell-seek is maintained by the members of NCBR and is improved by continous feedback!

Please see <code>cell-seek -h</code> for all available options.</p> <p>This part of the documentation describes options and concepts for <code>cell-seek cache</code> sub command in more detail. With minimal configuration, the <code>cache</code> sub command enables you to cache remote resources for the  cell-seek pipeline. Caching remote resources allows the pipeline to run in an offline mode. The cache sub command can also be used to pull our pre-built reference bundles onto a new cluster or target system.</p> <p>The cache sub command creates local cache on the filesysytem for resources hosted on DockerHub or AWS S3. These resources are normally pulled onto the filesystem when the pipeline runs; however, due to network issues or DockerHub pull rate limits, it may make sense to pull the resources once so a shared cache can be created and re-used. It is worth noting that a singularity cache cannot normally be shared across users. Singularity strictly enforces that its cache is owned by the user. To get around this issue, the cache subcommand can be used to create local SIFs on the filesystem from images on DockerHub.</p>"},{"location":"usage/cache/#2-synopsis","title":"2.
